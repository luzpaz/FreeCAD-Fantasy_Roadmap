# The FreeCAD Fantasy Roadmap

Below are ideas that I've encountered primarily on the FC forums that would be extremely interesting to see integrated:

### Graphical
* Ickby's widgetless alternative layout ([thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=23053))

### Backend
* Visual Programming on top of FreeCAD - DynamoBIM, qtnodes, nodeeditor([thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=7442))
